## Contributions
As most free / open source software projects we have happy if are willing to invest some time into this project and contribute. We are always looking for translators, documentators, testers and for sure also programmers. Translations are done on the [platform Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/piwigo-android) and documentation mainly here in this README file and the [wiki](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo-Android/wiki). If you consider contributing code best is to choose one of the tickets where you have a personal interest to get it done and comment on it with a proposal hwo you plan to solve the issue. Some where we believe they could be a good starting point are labeled with [help wanted](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo-Android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). For coding it would be great to have experience with MVVM, Android Data Binding, Depencency injections with Dagger 2 or Unit testing with Mockito and Robolectric. But even in case you have just a little Java experience and want to support we will help you to ramp up and guide you to learn the things you need for this project.
